FoodMins (restaurant website)

HTML5 – page structure.

CSS3 – base styles (+ your own style.css).

Tailwind CSS (utility classes) – used on the newer redesigned pages.

JavaScript (vanilla) – UI toggles, loader, simple validation.

Swiper.js – homepage/reviews sliders.

Font Awesome – icons.

(Optional) Firebase Web SDK – you included the Realtime Database client for registering/saving messages (client-side only; not a secure prod backend).

Dev/Infra

YAML (GitHub Actions) – workflow for GitHub Pages deploys.

Static assets – images/SVGs used throughout.

If you want, I can generate a concise “Tech Stack” section to drop into your README.
